## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The process begins from the Appilot dashboard where the user specifies channel URLs or search queries.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot automates the YouTube app or browser via UI Automator or ADB, visiting each channel, scrolling, and scraping the necessary stats.  
3. **Data Processing** â€” Extracted data is parsed, cleaned, and stored in a structured format (JSON/CSV/DB).  
4. **Output or Action** â€” Results are compared against historical data and presented in growth reports.  
5. **Other Functionalities** â€” Retry logic, logging, and scheduling can be configured to ensure consistent daily updates and fault tolerance.

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Python, Kotlin, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Selenium, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Scrcpy, Bluestacks, Firebase Test Lab, Accessibility  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy management, Task queues, Multi-device scaling
